    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is Braden Davis. Welcome to my website. Here, you'll learn everything about me.
      Please refer to the link below if you are interested in viewing my resume.
      This site contains information about myself that might not show up on my resume,
      so, get to know me more on here!
    </p>
    <p>
      I grew up in a town called Wheaton, Illinois. Nowadays, I am a third-year Computer Science/Cyber Security student
      (along with a minor in Finance) at Xavier Unviersity in Cincinnati, Ohio. Since I was little,
      I have always been fascinated with the inner workings of technology, and that fascination led me to my current passion of 
      software development. Check out my <a href="projects.html" target="_blank">projects</a>. In the near future, I plan on learning more about machine learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally, because I think about the inner workings of technology, I often think about the inner workings
      of my mind and how it thinks. <a style="font-weight: bold;">"How can I live my life to the fullest?"</a>
      This is the question I ask myself the most. In 2022 and 2023, I tried my best to answer this question with
      a clothing brand called "Happenings" based around my photography, which I posted on
      <a href="https://www.instagram.com/happeningsbraden/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.

      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      I successfully managed a website where I sold the clothes and got amazing support from friends and family. Along with the brand,
      Happenings, came its motto, <a style="font-style: italic;">Live a Little</a>, which means to stop worrying about
      the things you can't control, and focus on the things you can control. Although I am not currently working on the brand
      at the moment, I plan on returning to it one day to continue spreading that message.
